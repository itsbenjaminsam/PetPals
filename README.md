## 🎨 Design Process

The app's UI and UX were developed through:

- **Wireframing** – Initial low-fidelity sketches to define the layout and flow.
- **Mid-Fidelity Prototypes** – Created grayscale prototypes to refine navigation and placement.
- **User Feedback** – Gathered feedback through Google Forms surveys and informal testing sessions.
- **Iteration** – Updated designs based on feedback to improve usability and clarity.
